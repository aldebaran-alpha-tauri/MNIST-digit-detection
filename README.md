# MNIST-digit-detection
Implementation of a CNN to identify a handwritten digit, trained using the MNIST dataset.


The MNIST dataset has been used to train and test this elementary CNN model for classification of handwritten digits. 
The code used to save the model and test it against a separate image has also been included, along with an exported version of the trained model which can be directly downloaded and tested.
